K = Kinetic
Because domains are not static.
They move.
They drift.
They shift because of stimuli — mindset, weather, time, temperature, disaster, context.

Your entire theory is built on motion.

“Kinetic” captures that perfectly.

A = Alignment
Because success happens only when the agent (human, robot, machine) stays aligned with the domain.

Alignment is the heart of the theory.

D = Domains
Because everything — perception, data visibility, failure — is domain‑dependent.

KAD Theory

Kinetic Alignment of Domains

It’s clean.

It’s scientific.

It’s memorable.

It’s publishable.

Failure occurs when kinetic domain shifts break alignment between the agent and the environment.”
