Official Definition of KAD Theory

KAD: The Theory of Domain
KAD Theory states that all perception, data visibility, and agent performance are determined by the domain the agent is operating within. A domain is any set of conditions or stimuli that shape what an observer can perceive. Data can only be collected when the domain permits perception, and failure occurs when the agent and the domain fall out of alignment due to domain shifts or loss of domain focus.

Expanded Official Definition (for academic use)

KAD Theory defines a domain as the total set of environmental, cognitive, temporal, physical, and contextual conditions that determine what information is perceptible to an agent. Information exists continuously, but data only emerges when the domain allows the observer to detect and capture it. Agents succeed when their perception remains aligned with the active domain, and they fail when domain conditions change or when the agent loses focus on the domain.

Signature Sentence / (the one‑liner)

“Perception is domain‑dependent; failure is domain misalignment.”
