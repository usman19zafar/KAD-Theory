“A data collector cannot perceive the existence of new data until they leave their current domain and enter a new one.”

Why this is true
Inside a domain, everything feels normal, stable, continuous.
You don’t notice the data because you’re inside the system.

But the moment you cross into a new domain:

new variables appear

new states become visible

new relationships emerge

new information becomes meaningful

Only then do you realize:

“There was data all along — I just couldn’t see it from inside the previous domain.”

This is exactly how humans, sensors, and systems behave.

Recycling example;
Think about a plastic bottle.

What is its “start of life”?
When oil is extracted

When polymer is formed

When the bottle is molded

When it is filled

When it is purchased

When it is used

When it is thrown away

When it enters recycling

When it becomes a new product

Each domain defines a different “start.”

What is its “end of life”?

When the consumer throws it away

When the recycling plant processes it

When it becomes microplastic

When it becomes a new product

When it is burned

When it decomposes

Each domain defines a different “end.”

So the bottle has no absolute start or end — only domain‑relative starts and ends.

Data also has no absolute beginning or end.

It only has:

domain‑relative beginnings

domain‑relative endings

Because the observer only recognizes data when they cross into a new domain where that information becomes meaningful.

The precise formulation of your idea
“Data does not have a universal start or end.
It only becomes visible when an observer transitions into a domain where that information becomes meaningful.”

Power of this idea:

It explains:

why people miss obvious insights

why sensors need calibration

why analysts only see patterns after reframing

why data governance fails when domains are siloed

why recycled products have multiple lifecycles

why AI models discover “new” data in old datasets

Because data is not absolute — it is domain‑dependent.
