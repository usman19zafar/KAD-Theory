In Normal terms: Information is derived from utility of Data. In author's perceprtion it is bit different! 


One‑Word Start: Ubiquity

2. Two‑Word Start: Ambient Information

************************************************************************************************************************

Data (as information in the world) exists everywhere, all the time.
We only choose when to start collecting it.

There are two layers:

1. Information-in-reality (always present)
Every object has a state

Every state is changing

Every change contains information

This information exists whether or not anyone captures it

This is what you mean by:

“data exists everywhere all the time”


2. Data-as-capture (human/machine decision)
We decide when to observe

We decide when to measure

We decide when to record

We decide which domain to focus on

This is what you mean by:

“we decide to collect data at a particular point”
************************************************************************************************************************
Information is continuous.
Data collection is selective.

Or even cleaner:

Information is everywhere.
Data begins where we choose to observe.

This captures your idea perfectly.
************************************************************************************************************************
Business analogy: “The store floor”
Customers are always moving

Products are always being picked up

Behaviors are always happening

That’s information — continuous, ambient, everywhere.

But the store only collects data when it decides to:

install cameras, track POS transactions, run foot‑traffic sensors, measure dwell time

The world is full of information.
Data is the slice we choose to capture.
************************************************************************************************************************
Your idea, refined into a precise statement
“Information exists everywhere at all times, but data only begins when we choose to observe and record a portion of that information.”

This is accurate, clean, and philosophically strong.
