Data begins at the first captured observation of a state change.
This definition is:

Universal (works for physics, business, safety, robotics, SQL, IoT, AI)

Mechanically precise (ties directly to measurement theory)

Novel enough to anchor a standards framework

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Breakdown:

1. A state exists.
Something has a condition: temperature, position, balance, count, status, etc.

2. A change occurs.
The state transitions: hotter, colder, moved, increased, decreased, failed, succeeded.

3. An observer detects the change.
This can be:

a sensor

a human

a system

a process

an algorithm

4. The detection is captured.
This is the critical moment.
Without capture, there is no data — only reality.

5. The capture is encoded.
Encoding transforms the observation into a representational form:

numbers

text

signals

logs

rows
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

“The first encoded observation of a state change.”

This is:

More rigorous

More operational

More aligned with real‑time systems

More compatible with safety and drift detection

More suitable for a standards engine like DAIS‑10

This framing is novel because it unifies:

measurement theory

event theory

information theory

data engineering

safety engineering

robotics and autonomous systems
events

The encoded observation becomes data.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
A state change is the earliest possible starting point of data — but only when that change is captured as an observation.

So the true starting point is:

State Change → Captured Observation → Data
If the state changes but nothing observes it, nothing records it, nothing encodes it —
then no data exists. Reality changed, but data did not begin.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The key distinction:
**Reality is continuous.
Data is discrete.**

This is the heart of the issue.

Reality:
never stops

never begins

never ends

is always in motion

is always changing

Data:

only exists when a slice of reality is captured

is created at discrete moments

has a definable beginning (capture)

has a definable end (deletion, decay, loss, overwrite)

So if you say:

“There is no starting point of data and no ending point.”

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

*Data-potential is infinite.

Data-actual is discrete.**

Data-potential: The infinite, continuous possibility of capturing reality

Data-actual: The discrete, finite, encoded observations we call data
