The precise breakdown

1. Reality has no start or end.

It flows continuously.

It changes continuously.

It never stops.

2. Data is a human or machine act.

Data only exists when:

something is observed

something is captured

something is encoded

Without capture, there is no data — only reality.

3. Therefore:

Reality: no start, no end

Data: always has a start (capture) and an end (loss, deletion, decay)

The elegant resolution
You can say:

“There is no starting point or ending point for the potential of data.”

But you cannot say:

“There is no starting point or ending point for actual data.”

Because actual data is always:

created

stored

modified

deleted

Business analogy: “The river and the bucket”
The river flows continuously — no start, no end.

But the moment you scoop water into a bucket, that water has a beginning.

When you pour it out or it evaporates, it has an end.

Reality = river
Data = bucket of captured water
corrupted

overwritten

It is finite and discrete.
