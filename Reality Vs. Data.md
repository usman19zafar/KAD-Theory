The precise breakdown

1. Reality has no start or end.

It flows continuously.

It changes continuously.

It never stops.

2. Data is a human or machine act.

Data only exists when:

something is observed

something is captured

something is encoded

Without capture, there is no data — only reality.

3. Therefore:

Reality: no start, no end

Data: always has a start (capture) and an end (loss, deletion, decay)
